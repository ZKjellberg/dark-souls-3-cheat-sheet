## Contribution Guide

If you are interested in contributing to this guide, I welcome Pull Requests.

For some background on how the guide code is written, here is a sample item on the checklist.

```
<li data-id="playthrough_17_12" class="f_gear">Kill Sword Master Saber to get the Uchigatana and Master's Attire</li>
```

The **data-id** is a unique ID used to store the user's progress. For example, ***playthrough_17_12*** was the 12th task in zone 17. You can add new elements out of order, but they must be added in ascending order.

The **class="f_gear f_ring"** field is used for the filtering system. This task provides the user with gear and a ring, so we use ***f_gear*** and ***f_ring***. The full list of filter classes are listed below.

| Class    | Description |
|---       |---          |
| f_quest  | Main Quest  |
| f_npc    | NPC Quests  |
| f_gear   | Gear        |
| f_ring   | Ring        |
| f_spells | Spells      |
| f_estus  | Estus        |
| f_mat    | Materials   |
| f_misc   | Misc        |
