        <ul>
          <li data-id="playthrough_2_1">Free Greirat below the Tower on the Wall bonfire with the Cell Key, which is found at the bottom of the building that is past the same bonfire. Talk to him and agreed to give the Blue Tearstone Ring to Loretta. He will then return to Firelink Shrine.</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_2_2">Andre Progress: Grab Estus Shard on an altar in the room where you get the Cell Key.</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_2_3">After lighting the Tower on the Wall bonfire, return to Firelink Shrine and talk to Leonhard, who will give you 5 Cracked Red-Eye Orbs. He'll be by Prince Lothric's throne, if he isn't at this point, try killing Vordt and check again.</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_2_4">Talk to Emma, who is found the opposite direction of where Vordt is located, to receive the Way of Blue covenant and the Small Lothric Banner, which allows you to access the Undead Settlement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="Undead_Settlement"><a href="http://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Undead+Settlement">Undead Settlement</a> <span id="playthrough_totals_3"></span></h3>
        <ul>
          <li data-id="playthrough_3_1">Find Yoel below the Foot of the High Wall bonfire amongst several other Pilgrims. Talk to him and agree to his request and he'll head to Firelink Shrine</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_3_2">Yoel Progress: Head back to Firelink Shrine and talk to Yoel (Receive Beckon Gesture). If you want to pursue the Usurpation of Fire ending, follow next step</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_3_3">Yoel Progress: Accept Yoel's offer to Draw Out True Strength. You'll gain a free level, but also gain a Dark Sigil, which will start your Hollowing clock. Each time you die from here on out, you'll gain 1 Hollowing and become more and more Hollow, which also affects your appearance. Yoel will offer 4 more Draw Out True Strengths at Hollowing Level 2, 6, 12, and 16. Each additional Dark Sigil acts as…Double XP for your Hollowing Level, so it shouldn't take long to all 5 Dark Sigils (Just throw yourself off the cliff of Firelink Shrine over and over). If you do not do this step before reaching the Catacombs of Carthus, Yoel will automatically expire and you'll lose your chance at the Usurpation of Fire Ending</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_3_4">If you get all 5 Dark Sigils and refresh the world, Yoel will be dead and Yuria will be located near his dead body. Talk to her (Receive Dignified Bow Gesture) and buy the Londor Braille Divine Tome. You can give it to Irina when you get her if you want, but note that buying any of the spells it offers will lead to her bad ending. Otherwise, hang onto it until you find Karla later in the game</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_3_5">Greirat Progress: To find Loretta's Bone in Undead Settlement, spawn at the Undead Settlement bonfire and continue into the first house. Walk out onto the balcony and you'll see a hanging body you can cut down, which contains Loretta's Bone. Return to Firelink Shrine and give Greirat the item and he'll state you can keep the Blue Tearstone Ring</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_3_6">Andre Progress: Grab Estus Shard by the burning tree with worshipping undead. This is to the left of the Undead Settlement Bonfire, past the house</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_3_7">You can find the Warriors of Sunlight covenant in a hidden room in the building after the congregation in front of the tree. There will be a hole in the floor that you can drop into. Room also has an Estus Soup for reference</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_3_8">You can find the Mound-Makers covenant by climbing into the cage of the saw wielding enemy with an empty cage on his back, across the bridge and over the house from the Undead Settlement bonfire. You can only do this before the Curse-rotted Greatwood has been slain or else Holy Knight Hodrick will die from the floor breaking during the boss fight. If this does occur, you can acquire the covenant later through Sirris' side quest</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_3_9">Find Cornyx in the Undead Settlement above the Cliff Underside bonfire, which can be gotten by dropping to a ledge below the bridge that is right in front of the building that has 3 firebomb throwing undead on top of it. From the bonfire, get to the top of the building and kill the undead. You'll find a cage on the balcony that contains Cornyx. Agree to let him go to Firelink Shrine and he'll teleport there</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_3_10">Return to Firelink Shrine and talk with Cornyx (Receive Welcome Gesture and Pyromancy Flame). Also interact with Greirat, who should be taking the news of Loretta's death not so well (Receive Curl Up Gesture)</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_3_11">Find Irina and Eygon in front of the tower that can be found a little after the Cliff Underside bonfire, but you'll be unable to reach Irina until you have the Mortician's Ashes</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_3_12">Shrine Handmaid Progress: Grab the Mortician's Ashes at the graveyard with the falling spears, just ahead of the Dilapidated Bridge bonfire. If the spears are too much for you, grab a White Branch from the tree in the same graveyard and head to the tower to become friends with the Giant</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_3_13">Firelink Shrine Bonfire Progress: Grab the Undead Bone Shard to the right of the White tree on a platform you can jump to with a dead body</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_3_14">Return to Firelink Shrine and purchase the Grave Key, which opens the locked door in the sewer area with the rats next to the Dilapidated Bridge bonfire in Undead Settlement. Upon talking to Irina, she'll teleport to Firelink Shrine if you allow her</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_3_15">Return to Firelink Shrine and talk to Irina (Receive Prayer Gesture)</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_3_16">Find Siegward, who is inside the Tower near Irina and Eygon. He'll be taking the elevator down and question the mechanics of the thing. Get on the elevator and you'll go to the basement which has a Outrider Knight and the entrance to Road of Sacrifices. Kill the Outrider Knight and rest at the bonfire nearby. If you die, that works too. Return to the Tower entrance and take the lift up to the actual top of the Tower (If you keep going to the basement, hit the switch on the elevator while at the main entrance and then quickly jump off to reveal the lift that takes you up). Roll off at the mid-way point to land on a wooden platform. Head outside and speak to Siegward again. Run down and begin fighting the Fire Demon, Siegward will eventually come and help. After killing the Fire Demon, speak to Siegward three times (Receive Siegbrau, Toast Gesture, and Rest Gesture)</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_3_17">Kill the Curse-rotted Greenwood to get the Transposing Kiln, which you can give to Ludleth of Courtland back at Firelink Shrine to turn boss souls into special weapons and items</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_3_18">Leonhard Progress: Return to Firelink Shrine and talk to Leonhard (Receive Applause Gesture)</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_3_19">Hawkwood Progress: Talk to Hawkwood after killing the Curse-rotted Greatwood (Receive Heavy Gem). If he doesn't give you anything, come back to him after killing the Crystal Sage</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="Road_of_Sacrifices"><a href="http://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Road+of+Sacrifices">Road of Sacrifices</a> <span id="playthrough_totals_4"></span></h3>
        <ul>
          <li data-id="playthrough_4_1">Greirat Progress: Around this time or before, you can now send Greirat to pillage Undead Settlement. After you depart Firelink Shrine after agreeing to send him out, he'll be missing until you kill a boss</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_4_2">Irina Progress: You can find the Braille Divine Tome of Carim below the bridge right before the Halfway Fortress bonfire. Give it to her at Firelink Shrine and buy all the spells it offers if you want her to become a Fire Keeper later in the game</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_4_3">Talk to Anri and Horace at the Halfway Fortress bonfire. Horace will give you the Blue Sentinels covenant when spoken to. Make sure to deplete Anri's dialogue before continuing on</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_4_4">Cornyx Progress: In the swamp area with the two giant enemy crabs, the Great Swamp Pyromancy Tome will be in an area of the swamp that causes you to fat roll</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_4_5">Kill Yellowfinger Heysel, who will invade your world if you are embered around the area where the two giant crabs are</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_4_6">Andre Progress: At the Halfway Fortress bonfire in Road of Sacrifices, head out and drop down from the ledges on the right side, keep going straight along the right wall and enter a doorway in the end. Turn left and you will see a Black Knight guarding a few bodies, the body at the end of the hall holds the Farron Coal, which grants you Heavy, Sharp and Poison Infusions</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_4_7">Andre Progress: Grab the Estus Shard on the side of the ruins near the Crucifixion Woods bonfire. It will be near a fire that has two Lycanthropes</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_4_8">Enter the ruins near the Crucifixion Woods bonfire, head up the stairs, cross the bridge, and you'll notice an area to the left right after getting off the bridge that'll lead you to the upper area of the ruins that contains Orbeck. Talk to him and he'll agree to teach you in sorceries only if you have at least a 10 in Intelligence. You'll also make him a promise to give him scrolls to learn more spells, you MUST give him a scroll before defeating the Abyss Watchers or else he will leave</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="Cathedral_of_the_Deep"><a href="http://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Cathedral+of+the+Deep">Cathedral of the Deep</a> <span id="playthrough_totals_5"></span></h3>
        <ul>
          <li data-id="playthrough_5_1">Talk to Sirris at Firelink Shrine to begin her quest line</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_5_2">Shrine Handmaid Progress: Near the first bonfire behind a hostile NPC are the Paladin's Ashes</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_5_3">Andre Progress: Grab the Estus Shard right outside the Cleansing Chapel bonfire where enemies are praying</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_5_4">Irina/Karla Progress: The Deep Braille Divine Tome can be found on a mimic chest. Remember, giving this to Irina and buying any of the spells it unlocks will lock you into the bad ending of her quest. I recommend saving this for Karla, unless you really want some of the spells</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_5_5">Firelink Shrine Bonfire Progress: Grab the Undead Bone Shard near a white tree that the Giant throws spears around, on the roof area of the Cathedral after navigating the graveyard and crossing a bridge</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_5_6">Continue through the Cathedral of the Deep until you have made it to the fog door before the Deacons of the Deep boss fight. Head to the nearby lift to activate the final shortcut of the level (Opening the large blue double doors that lead out to the Cathedral's roof)</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_5_7">If you leave the Cathedral completely (Go to Firelink Shrine and come back) and then head back into the Cathedral through the large blue double doors you just opened, you may notice that a new bridge has been activated and Siegward is standing next to them. Talk to him and then cross the bridge to trigger a cutscene where it is revealed it was really Patches. Depending on if you killed the Giants or not, you'll either have to fight one or nothing happens</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_5_8">Patches Progress: From here, head out to the 2nd shortcut back to the Cleansing Chapel bonfire and use the lift to get to a crossbow undead's tower. Kill him and move towards the edge of the tower, but don't drop down. Instead, look to see that you can move towards the left and find a ladder. Ascend the ladder and continue up the roof to eventually reach the rafters of the Cathedral. You'll now be able to drop down to the other side of the bridge that Patches activated. Patches will be waiting here and pretend to not be responsible for what just happened. Tell him "You know who I am" (Receive Prostration Gesture). You can then buy Siegward's Armor Set from him</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_5_9">Leonhard Progress: Before leaving this area, continue on up the nearby stairs and you'll eventually find yourself at the Rosaria's Chamber bonfire. Speak with Rosaria to obtain the Rosaria's Fingers covenant. Do not do anything further with this covenant if you intend to do Sirris' quest line. Don't give Rosaria any Pale Tongues and don't equip the Rosaria's Fingers covenant item. We'll continue this side quest closer to the end of the game</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_5_10">Patches Progress: If Patches didn't spawn at the Cathedral, return to Firelink Shrine and purchase the Tower Key if you haven't already and head into the Tower behind Firelink Shrine now. As you ascend the lift to the top, you'll hear a door shut behind you. Grab the Fire Keeper's Soul at the top and then come back down to encounter Patches. He has locked the door and you'll need to drop down from the bridge onto coffins to escape</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_5_11">Andre Progress: Head back to the Tower and get to the bridge that overlooks Firelink Shrine. Drop down onto the roof and move around the roof until you find some windows you can go through. A Estus Shard will be on the rafters</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_5_12">While on the roof, you can talk to Snuggly the Crow. Trading him three items will get you the Call Over Gesture</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_5_13">Fire Keeper Progress: With the Fire Keeper's Soul, you can heal Dark Sigils that you have in order to completely get rid of your Hollowing Level. If you are following Yoel/Yuria's quest line, however, don't do this until the post game or you'll end up angering Yoel/Yuria</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_5_14">Patches Progress: Refresh Firelink Shrine and head to the upper right to find Patches now located there. He'll ask for forgiveness, refuse (Receive Prostration Gesture and Rusted Gold Coin). You can then buy Siegward's Armor Set from him. Leaving Firelink Shrine and returning will sometimes allow Patches to be in his squatting position. Interact with him (Receive Patches Squat Gesture)</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_5_15">Siegward Progress: If you can't buy Siegward's Armor Set yet, head to the Cleansing Chapel and check the well at the entrance, where Siegward should be stuck in. After speaking to him, return to whatever location Patches is at for you and buy the armor</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_5_16">Siegward Progress: Return to the well Siegward is in and drop the armor it to him (Receive Rejoice Gesture)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="Farron_Keep"><a href="http://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Farron+Keep">Farron Keep</a> <span id="playthrough_totals_6"></span></h3>
        <ul>
          <li data-id="playthrough_6_1">Andre Progress: From the first bonfire of Farron Keep, stay to the left side until you reach a small structure guarded by a darkwraith. The Sage's Coal is in a body inside this structure, which grants you Crystal, Blessed and Deep Infusions</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_6_2">Andre Progress: Grab the Estus Shard as you come into the area from Road of Sacrifices, towards the left. The shard will be visible against a wall</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_6_3">Orbeck Progress: Spawn at the Keep Ruins bonfire and go out towards the Wolf Gate and turn left. Follow the wall and you'll eventually find the Sage's Scroll</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_6_4">Orbeck Progress: From the first bonfire, head out and go towards the right where you'll start to encounter basilisks. There will be a cave in this area that will contain a chest with the Golden Scroll inside. Make sure to give these scrolls to him before beating the Abyss Watchers or he'll leave forever</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_6_5">Firelink Shrine Bonfire Progress: Grab the Undead Bone Shard on the bottom of the tower to the right of the Wolf Gate with the three flames that you have to light. It is surrounded by a bunch of slugs</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_6_6">Anri Progress: Return to Firelink Shrine to find Anri and Horace left of the thrones. You can speak to them for some additional dialogue</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_6_7">Climb the giant ladder near the Keep Ruins bonfire to find the Old Wolf of Farron. Interact with him for the Watchdogs of Farron covenant (Receive Legion Etiquette Gesture)</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_6_8">Shrine Handmaid Progress: In this room, you'll see a dead body with something on it. Head out to the stairs and slash a wall once you get up them to reveal a illusory wall that leads to the body to get Dreamchaser's Ashes</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_6_9">Sirris Progress: Return to Firelink Shrine and after giving the Dreamchaser's Ashes to the Shrine Handmaid, refresh the world with a bonfire. Sirris will once again be there. Talk to her. (Receive Darkmoon Loyalty Gesture)</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_6_10">Yellowfinger Heysel Progess: You can summon her in Farron Keep right after the Keep Ruins bonfire for the Abyss Watchers fight if you killed her in Road of Sacrifices, but you'll need to have given a Pale Tongue to Rosaria, which will block you out of Sirris' quest line, so I recommend saving this part for another playthrough. You'll gain the Proper Bow Gesture after her summon</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_6_11">Black Hand Gotthard can be summoned for the Abyss Watchers fight and will grant you the By My Sword Gesture upon summon</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_6_12">Yuria Progress: If you are doing the Yoel/Yuria side quest, you'll also be able to summon the Londor Pale Shade for the Abyss Watchers fight and gain the Duel Bow Gesture</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="Catacombs_of_Carthus"><a href="http://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Catacombs+of+Carthus">Catacombs of Carthus</a> <span id="playthrough_totals_7"></span></h3>
        <ul>

          <li data-id="playthrough_13_16">Leonhard Progress: Head to the Aldrich bonfire in Anor Londo and take either of the lifts in the room up. The Black Eye Orb will react to this room. Use it and you'll invade Leonhard's world. Kill him for Rosaria's Soul, Crescent Moon Sword, and the Silver Mask. You can also now buy Leonhard's Armor Set from the Shrine Handmaid. You can either return Rosaria's Soul to her body or give it to Ludleth for the Bountiful Sunlight Miracle. Considering you can still interact with her body even if she's dead, I'd give it to Ludleth</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_13_17">Put all the Lord of Cinders back on their thrones if you haven't already and then interact with the Firelink Shrine Bonfire to be teleported to the Kiln of the First Flame</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_13_18">Yuria Progress: You can summon Yuria for the Soul of Cinder fight. After the fight, go to Firelink Shrine and where Yuria normally is will now be her Black Armor Set and Darkdrift</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_13_19">Ending Guide: Depending on what you've done at this point, you will have certain options for the endings you can select</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_13_20">Ending 1: Simply interact with the First Flame results in the 'To Link the First Flame' ending. This is the standard ending</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_13_21">Ending 2: If you obtained the Eyes of a Fire Keeper from the Untended Graves area and gave them to the Fire Keeper you can use a summon sign next to the bonfire to trigger the 'The End of Fire' ending</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_13_22">Ending 3: If you follow the steps to Ending #2, during the final scene you have a short window where you regain control of your character. You can attack the Fire Keeper after the cutscene for a different version of the ‘The End of Fire' ending</li>
          <li data-id="playthrough_13_23">Ending 4: If you followed the Yoel/Yuria quest line to this point and "married" Anri, you can usurp the flame by wrestling the flame from its mantle triggering the 'Usurpation of Fire' ending. To progress this option, you must have 8 total Dark Sigils. The 5 from Yoel's Draw Out True Strengths and the 3 from "marrying" Anri. Simply interact with the First Flame at this point and it'll activate</li>

        <h2>Help</h2>

        <h3>Is this a guide?</h3>
        <p>Nope, not really. This is a set of checklists and information that you can use while playing Dark Souls to make sure you don't miss an item, action, conversation or boss. If you need playthroughs then you can click on the links scattered throughout the page to find them in the wiki.</p>

        <h3>Do I need to follow the playthrough in this exact order?</h3>
        <p>Dark Souls 3 is not a linear game and has multiple ways of progressing. This is generally the way I like to play through the game, so feel free to follow it if you like or mix it up. You can always jump back and forth and check things off in a different order.</p>

        <h3>Can I use this for multiple characters?</h3>
        <p>Yup, use the profile selector and buttons at the top right of the page to setup multiple characters.</p>

        <h3>How do I help with feedback, corrections, suggestions or additions?</h3>
        <p>You can post in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/4fmjyu/dark_souls_3_cheat_sheet_checklist/">this Reddit thread</a> or if you know your way about Git/GitHub then fork <a href="https://github.com/ZKjellberg/dark-souls-3-cheat-sheet">my repo</a> and submit a pull request.</p>

        <p>Thanks to the following people for their suggestions, fixes and improvements</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="">?</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How does the checklist status get saved?</h3>
        <p>It gets saved to the local storage in your browser and not to any database or API. So if you are clearing your browser cache make sure not to delete the site data or your checklists will get reset.</p>
